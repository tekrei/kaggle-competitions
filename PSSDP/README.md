## Porto Seguro’s Safe Driver Prediction

This folder contains Python scripts for [Porto Seguro’s Safe Driver Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/c/porto-seguro-safe-driver-prediction/) competition.

- In these scripts [DMLC XGBoost](https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost), [Microsoft LightGBM](https://github.com/Microsoft/LightGBM), and Apache Spark MLlib (https://spark.apache.org/mllib/) algorithms are used.
- Single, cross-validated or stacked ensemble solutions are tested for this competition.
- All of these scripts are developed with Python 3 and they require XGBoost, LightGBM, Spark MLlib, [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org), [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) libraries to be installed in advance.
- For usage of scripts [data files](https://www.kaggle.com/c/porto-seguro-safe-driver-prediction/data) of the competition must be downloaded and put into `input` folder.
